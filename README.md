# Equalizer landing page responsive with HTML/CSS only !

![DESIGN-IMG](preview.jpg)

# Challenges faced :

A small, but really beautiful landing page built with just HTML & CSS ! This landing page looked so good I had to try to code it out :D ! Again, with the figma file it took much less time than it would've without it !

I tried my best once again to make it as pixel perfect as possible, and I think I managed to pull it off this time. This really tested my ability with CSS, specifically with `background-position` and dynamic layouts beyond just grid and flexbox ! I had a bit of trouble finding out exactly how to change the layout of the phone illustration (`main__illustration`) and the pricing card from the mobile view, to having them side by side like in the tablet and desktop view. I ended up using hiding the phone illustration container with `display: none` and turning its parent container (`main__container`) into the background, relative to the phone illustration and the pricing card ! Funny enough, maybe I wouldn't have thought about this if it weren't for my previous challenge, the meet landing page , so it all worked out in the end !
