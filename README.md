# Equalizer landing page responsive with HTML/CSS only !

![DESIGN-IMG](preview.jpg)

# Challenges faced :

A small, but really beautiful landing page built with just HTML & CSS ! This landing page looked so good I had to try to code it out :D ! Again, with the figma file it took much less time than it would've without it !

I tried my best once again to make it as pixel perfect as possible, and I think I managed to pull it off this time. This really tested my ability with CSS, specifically with `background-position` and dynamic layouts beyond just grid and flexbox !
