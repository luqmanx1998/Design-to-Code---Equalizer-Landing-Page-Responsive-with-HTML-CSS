# Equalizer Landing Page - Responsive with HTML/CSS Only!

![DESIGN-IMG](preview.jpg)

## Overview

This small but beautifully designed landing page was a joy to build using just HTML and CSS! The design was so impressive that I couldn't resist coding it out. Thanks to the Figma file, I was able to focus on achieving pixel perfection, and I'm really pleased with the result :D .

## Challenges Faced

- **Dynamic Layout Adjustments:** 
  One of the biggest challenges was transitioning the layout from mobile to desktop views, specifically with the phone illustration (`main__illustration`) and the pricing card. Initially, I struggled to find the right approach, but I eventually used a technique where I hid the phone illustration container with `display: none` and turned its parent container into the background. This solution was inspired by my previous work on the meet landing page.

- **Background Positioning:** 
  Fine-tuning the `background-position` was key to getting the layout just right. This project pushed my skills in dynamic layouts beyond the basics of grid and flexbox, and I'm happy with the outcome.

## Tools & Techniques

- **HTML5 & CSS3**
- **Responsive Design:** Leveraging `display`, `position`, and other CSS properties to create a fluid, adaptable layout, beyond just media queries.
- **Problem-Solving:** Drawing on previous project experience to solve new challenges.
